## Problem Statement
In an academic environment, administrative work often consumes a significant portion of time. Professors, society members /students, and office staff spend hours:
1.  **Drafting formal emails** for announcements, notices, and individual feedback.
2.  **Designing event posters** for seminars, hackathons, and recruitment drives.
3.  **Creating brand concepts** for new societies or initiatives.
4.  **Preparing Report from raw notes** into structured departmental reports.

>**Nimbus** solves this by providing a unified, role-aware dashboard where AI agents handle these tasks in seconds, maintaining a consistent professional standard across the institution.
